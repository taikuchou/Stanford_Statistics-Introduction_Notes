    "### What is Bayesian Analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bayesian analysis is a statistical method that updates beliefs (probabilities) when new evidence becomes available.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It starts with a prior probability (initial belief), incorporates new evidence, and produces a posterior probability (updated belief).\n",
    "\n",
    "The updating rule is Bayes’ Rule: **P(A∣B)= P(B∣A)⋅P(A)/P(B)** \n"
